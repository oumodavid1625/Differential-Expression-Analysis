# Differential Expression Analysis Using R

Differential expression analysis is a widely used technique in bioinformatics to identify genes or features that are differentially expressed between two or more conditions (e.g., treated vs. untreated, diseased vs. healthy). 

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps of performing differential expression analysis using R, focusing on RNA-seq data.

We will use the DESeq2 package, one of the most popular tools for differential expression analysis. This tutorial assumes you have basic knowledge of R and RNA-seq data.

1. Install and Load Required Packages
First, install and load the necessary R packages. If you haven't installed them yet, run the following commands:

# Install Bioconductor (if not already installed)
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# Install DESeq2 and other necessary packages
BiocManager::install("DESeq2")
BiocManager::install("ggplot2")
BiocManager::install("pheatmap")

# Load the libraries

```{R}
library(DESeq2)
library(ggplot2)
library(pheatmap)

```

2. Prepare Your Data

Differential expression analysis requires two main inputs:

Count matrix: A table where rows represent genes and columns represent samples. Each value is the raw read count for a gene in a sample.

Metadata: A table describing the experimental design, such as sample names, conditions, and other covariates.

Example Data

For this tutorial, we'll use a simulated dataset. Replace this with your own data in practice.

# Example count matrix (genes as rows, samples as columns)

```{r}
count_data <- matrix(rnbinom(1000, mu=100, size=1/0.5), nrow=100, ncol=10)
rownames(count_data) <- paste0("Gene_", 1:100)
colnames(count_data) <- paste0("Sample_", 1:10)

```

# Example metadata (sample information)

```{r}
col_data <- data.frame(
  condition = factor(rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), each=5)),
  batch = factor(rep(c("Batch1", "Batch2"), times=5))
)
rownames(col_data) <- colnames(count_data)

```

3. Create a DESeqDataSet Object

The DESeqDataSet is the core object used by DESeq2 to store the count data and metadata.

# Create DESeqDataSet object

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_data,
                              colData = col_data,
                              design = ~ condition)

```

countData: The count matrix.

colData: The metadata.

design: The experimental design formula. Here, we are testing for differences between conditions.

4. Preprocessing and Normalization

DESeq2 automatically normalizes the data using the median of ratios method. You can also filter out low-count genes to improve results.

# Filter out genes with very low counts

```{r}
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep,]

```

# Run DESeq2 analysis

```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)

```

5. Extract Results

After running the analysis, extract the results for differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

# Get results for the contrast "Treatment vs Control"

```{r}
res <- results(dds, contrast = c("condition", "Treatment", "Control"))

```

# Summarize the results

```{r}
summary(res)

```

res contains log2 fold changes, p-values, and adjusted p-values (FDR) for each gene.

Use summary(res) to get an overview of the number of up- and down-regulated genes.

6. Visualize Results

Visualization is crucial for interpreting the results. Here are some common plots:

MA Plot
Shows the relationship between mean expression and log2 fold change.

```{r}
plotMA(res, ylim=c(-2, 2))

```

Volcano Plot

Highlights significant genes based on log2 fold change and p-values.

# Create a volcano plot

```{r}
res_df <- as.data.frame(res)
res_df$significant <- res_df$padj < 0.05 & abs(res_df$log2FoldChange) > 1

ggplot(res_df, aes(x=log2FoldChange, y=-log10(padj), color=significant)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Volcano Plot", x="Log2 Fold Change", y="-Log10 Adjusted P-value")

```

Heatmap
Visualizes expression patterns of top DEGs.

# Select top 20 DEGs

```{r}
top_genes <- head(order(res$padj), 20)
top_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)[top_genes,]

# Plot heatmap
pheatmap(top_counts, scale="row", clustering_distance_rows="correlation")

```

7. Save Results
Save the results to a file for further analysis or sharing.

# Write results to a CSV file

```{r}
write.csv(as.data.frame(res), file="differential_expression_results.csv")

```

8. Advanced Options
Adding covariates: If you have additional covariates (e.g., batch effects), include them in the design formula: design = ~ batch + condition.

Shrunken log2 fold changes: Use lfcShrink to get more accurate fold change estimates:

```{r}
res_shrink <- lfcShrink(dds, coef="condition_Treatment_vs_Control", type="apeglm")

```

9. Interpretation

Log2 fold change: Indicates the magnitude and direction of differential expression.

Adjusted p-value (FDR): Controls for multiple testing. Genes with padj < 0.05 are typically considered significant.

# Let us now go through the airway dataset in R

This dataset contains RNA-seq data from airway smooth muscle cells treated with dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid. 
We will use the DESeq2 package to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between treated and untreated samples.

## 1. Load the airway library

```{R}
library(airway)

```

## 2. Load the airway Dataset

The airway dataset is a pre-processed RNA-seq dataset included in the airway package. It contains raw counts and metadata for 8 samples (4 treated with dexamethasone and 4 untreated controls).

```{r}
data("airway")

```

View the dataset

```{r}
airway

```

The airway object is a SummarizedExperiment object, which contains:

Count matrix: Accessible with assay(airway).

Metadata: Accessible with colData(airway).

The count matrix

```{r}
assay(airway)

```
The metadata

```{r}
colData(airway)

```

## 3. Extract Count Matrix and Metadata

Extract the count matrix and metadata from the airway object.

Extract the count matrix

```{r}
count_data <- assay(airway)

```

Extract the metadata

```{r}
col_data <- colData(airway)

```

View the metadata

```{r}
col_data

```

The metadata contains information about the samples, including the treatment status (dex column: trt for treated and untrt for untreated).

## 4. Create a DESeqDataSet Object

The DESeqDataSet is the core object used by DESeq2 to store the count data and metadata.

Create DESeqDataSet object

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_data,
                              colData = col_data,
                              design = ~ dex)

```

countData: The count matrix.

colData: The metadata.

design: The experimental design formula. Here, we are testing for differences between treatment groups (dex).

## 5. Preprocessing and Normalization

DESeq2 automatically normalizes the data using the median of ratios method. You can also filter out low-count genes to improve results.

Filter out genes with very low counts

```{r}
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep,]

```

Run DESeq2 analysis

```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)

```

## 6. Extract Results

After running the analysis, extract the results for differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

Get results for the contrast "treated vs untreated"

```{r}
res <- results(dds, contrast = c("dex", "trt", "untrt"))

```

Summarize the results

```{r}
summary(res)

```

res contains log2 fold changes, p-values, and adjusted p-values (FDR) for each gene.

Use summary(res) to get an overview of the number of up- and down-regulated genes.

## 7. Visualize Results

Visualization is crucial for interpreting the results. Here are some common plots:

MA Plot

Shows the relationship between mean expression and log2 fold change.

```{r}
plotMA(res, ylim=c(-2, 2))

```

Volcano Plot

Highlights significant genes based on log2 fold change and p-values.
Create a volcano plot

```{r}
res_df <- as.data.frame(res)
res_df$significant <- res_df$padj < 0.05 & abs(res_df$log2FoldChange) > 1

ggplot(res_df, aes(x=log2FoldChange, y=-log10(padj), color=significant)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Volcano Plot", x="Log2 Fold Change", y="-Log10 Adjusted P-value")

```

Heatmap

Visualizes expression patterns of top DEGs.
Select top 20 DEGs

```{r}
top_genes <- head(order(res$padj), 20)
top_counts <- counts(dds, normalized=TRUE)[top_genes,]

# Plot heatmap
pheatmap(top_counts, scale="row", clustering_distance_rows="correlation")

```

## 8. Save Results

Save the results to a file for further analysis or sharing.
Write results to a CSV file

```{r}
write.csv(as.data.frame(res), file="differential_expression_results.csv")

```
